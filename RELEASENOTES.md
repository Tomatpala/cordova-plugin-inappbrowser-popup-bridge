### 1.0.10 (Jan 30, 2018)

### 1.0.9 (Jan 30, 2018)
Bug fix for iOS crash when current IAB URL is nil

### 1.0.8 (Jan 24, 2018)
- Fix for the previous hiding strategy which caused JS errors in target pages on iOS 11 due to loading the target page while WKWebView instance was in a detached state.
- This strategy has been tested and should work on iOS 9/10/11

### 1.0.7 (Jan 17, 2018)
- Make hiding mechanism conditional depending on iOS version.
    - Since the frame.origin method works fine on iOS 9&10 but causes native input issues (e.g. date picket) on iOS 11.
    - And the makeKeyAndVisible method works fine on iOS 11 but causes content sizing issues on iOS 9&10.

### 1.0.5 (Dec 12, 2017)
